# The Ultimate TypeScript Course

## Welcome to the TypeScript Course

Welcome to the TypeScript course! In this course we will delve into the world of TypeScript. Explore its features and capabilities. Before we begin lets lay the groundwork by understanding some concepts.

### Understanding Programming Languages

Programming languages can be broadly classified into two categories;

1. **Statically Typed Languages;**
   Examples include C++, C# Java and more.
   Typed languages determine types during compilation and maintain them throughout execution.

2. **Dynamically Typed Languages;**
   Examples include Python, JavaScript, Ruby, among others.
   Typed languages determine types during runtime and allow for changes, during execution.

### TypeScript: JavaScript with Superpowers

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that brings typing benefits to the JavaScript ecosystem. It offers the following advantages;

**Static Typing;** TypeScript adds type checking during compilation identifying errors before they occur at runtime.

**Enhanced Development Experience;** We have improved the tools to developers by providing code editors, auto completions and code navigation features.

**Improved Readability;** By incorporating type annotations into your code we make it more self explanatory and easier to understand.

**Robustness;** With TypeScript you can expect runtime errors and enjoy more predictable behavior, in your applications.

### Compiling TypeScript to JavaScript

Web browsers are unable to comprehend TypeScript which is why we rely on the TypeScript compiler to convert our TypeScript code into JavaScript. This converted JavaScript code is what browsers can interpret and execute. To facilitate the debugging process we utilize source maps that establish a connection, between the TypeScript code and its corresponding JavaScript version.

### Configuring TypeScript

To optimize the TypeScript compiler we have the option to adjust parameters in a configuration file called `tsconfig.json`. This file enables us to tailor the compilation process according to our projects requirements.

## Course Overview

Now that we have a basic understanding of TypeScript and its role in modern web development, let's take a sneak peek at what you'll learn in this course:

- **Module 1. [Introduction, to TypeScript](./1%20Fundamentals/README.md) ;** Begin by exploring the fundamentals, including variables, data types, functions and other essential concepts.
